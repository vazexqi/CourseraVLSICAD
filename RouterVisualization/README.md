### Simple visualization for a router (VLSI CAD)

The goal of this project is to visualize a routing layout entirely
inside the web browser. The visualization is rather simple: displaying a
bunch of cells, some empty and some colored according to their wires. We
are making use of the [d3js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3)library and
its SVG capabilities. It will make use of the HTML 5 File facility to
support drag-n-drop of files directly into the web browser for
visualization.

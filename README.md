===============

Open-source components for our course. This project lists the parts that are both public and open so that others who are interested in re-implementing some of the features may benefit. There is another closed source version that handles the actual grading. Thus, the integrity of the grades is not compromised.

Projects
--------

Here are the main components of this repository. Each one can be run separately.

### Submitter

A user interface for submitting assignments and also viewing the results of the submission.

### Grader

The Groovy backend for lauching external graders.

### External Process Examples

Some simple examples of running external processes through Groovy.

### Packager

A simple test script to test that everything has been installed properly.

Development
-----------

Everything can be developed through the use of a simple text editor and some manipulation of gradle scripts.

However, it is often easier to use a proper IDE that supports Groovy. Personally, I use [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). They have a free [community edition](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html) that works well.

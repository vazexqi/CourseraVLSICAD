### Introduction

This is a _very_ simple Java implementation of a conjugate gradient solver. It
is distributed as part of the starter files for Programming Assignment #3 of
our VLSI CAD: Logic to Layout Coursera course.

### Running

There is no _main_ method but there are several test cases illustrating its
use.

Assuming that you have the Java JDK installed, you can execute `./gradlew test`
in the current directory to run the tests. You can then view the results in the 
build/reports/test folder.

### Acknowledgements

Prof. [Luke Olson](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/homes/lukeo/) provided the original
C++ implementation of the conjugate gradient solver.  However, any bugs in this
translated version is due to us.
